Spend a couple of hours in a room with other bcgov use[R](https://www.r-project.org/)s, new and experienced. Work collaboratively with a colleague, get help on something you are working on or want to learn, help and mentor others. Maybe...

- troubleshoot that R/RStudio installation?
- learn a bit about version control & git?
- join bcgov GitHub and get some help with that [two-factor authentication](https://github.com/bcgov/BC-Policy-Framework-For-GitHub/blob/master/BC-Gov-Org-HowTo/Cheatsheet.md)?
- get some help with that code chunk that keeps erroring?
- test drive a new-to-you R package?
- find someone to review some project code?
- learn more about Shiny or debug a Shiny app you are working on?
- learn more about writing functions, or your own package?
